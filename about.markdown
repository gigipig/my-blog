Hello. You are now reading my first blog-post, ever. The things I will be posting here will range from random and disorganised thoughts to various, well-organised snippets of work completed throughout my university degree, or during my spare time.
You might be wondering why I am bothering with this endeavour, and I donâ€™t blame you, but I feel compelled to at least give this whole blogging thing a shot. 
I look forward to making this commitment.
