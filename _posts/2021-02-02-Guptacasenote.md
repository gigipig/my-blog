Gupta v Uber

    Justice Ross, VP Hatcher, DP Colman

Introduction

The recent decision by the Fair Work Commission(‘FWC’) in Gupta further solidifies the status of Uber drivers in Australia as independent contractors, and not Employees.

In dismissing the appeal of Amita Gupta, the FWC reconfirmed the traditional multi-factorial approach as the leading method to classify the nature of work done by drivers within the current ‘gig-economy’.  

While this decision provides guidance as to the rights and obligations of drivers and gig-economy businesses, such as Uber, it offers little in respect to the changing nature of work impacted by new technologies. 

In a way, Gupta’s applicability remains confined to the traditional orthodoxy of employment, and growing concern surrounds its ability to accommodate the growing complexity of the employment landscape through its reluctance to depart from the . 

By looking outwards and observing the way in which other jurisdictions deal with the evolving nature of work, Australia may be able to offer greater levels of fairness and security for those ‘captive’ within the gig-economy.
